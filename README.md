# libft
Libft is one of the 1337's project ... the concept is to rebuild some of predefined functions in C and build some others 
those functions will be really useful in the upcoming projects that will be your own library that you are allowed to use it whenever you need it .

NB : you need to respect what the subject says and build the predefined functions in the same original's behavior i didn't like the segfaulting happend in some functions like when you enter the "NULL" parameters to the function as an arguments ... be careful you shouldn't "PROTECT" all the functions as i did :) (if you like to do it, do it after the  evaluation)
